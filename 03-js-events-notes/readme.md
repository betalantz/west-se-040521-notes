# Intro Js
## Events
- Create event listeners
- Distinguish between event types
- Explain when and why to use event listeners
- Write event listeners as stand-alone functions and in-line functions
- Use event listeners to manipulate the DOM
- Delegate events using the event.target
- Synthesize knowledge of forms with event listeners

## What are Events
[List of Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)
- The user clicking the mouse over a certain element or hovering the cursor over a certain element.
- The user pressing a key on the keyboard.
- The user resizing or closing the browser window.
- A web page finishing loading.
- A form being submitted.
- A video being played, or paused, or finishing play.
- An error occurring.


- What are events you know? (Cookie Clicker)
- Show adding click event listener to document on wiki
- Remove e.targets to delete whole page
- requires e.preventDefault()

- show Events MDN

- show existing code

- select and log ul => ul li
- caution: getElement vs querySelector
- iterate li's
- add listeners in iterator
- log event => e.target
- find cat from allCats with e.target.textContent

- refactor to organize => encapulate in addListeners() and abstract handleClick()
- build loadCat

- talk about forms
- build handleSubmit

- build addToAside()

- show DOMContentLoaded by removing defer from script tag and moving init fn calls to listener








```js

const firstBtnOnPage = document.querySelector('button')

firstBtnOnPage.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log('BUTTON WAS CLICKED')
})
// We are telling addEventListener to invoke the anonymous function 
// passed as the second argument when the event fires; 
// we're waiting for something to happen then responding to this event.

   document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event){
     // code here will not run until the document loads
  })
// Here, we are telling addEventListener invoke the anonymous function after the document loads

```

### preventDefault()

Forms will attempt to make an HTTP POST request on submission. Recall from Mod2 that our forms would send a POST request that was then handled by our controller (remember HTTP and the request/response cycle?). If we give our form an action attribute, it will try to POST to the endpoint specified by the action attribute:

```

<form id="comment-form" action="/hotdog">
  <div class="field">
    <input id="new-comment" type="text" placeholder="New Comment" />
    <input type="submit" class="btn" value="Submit" />
  </div>
</form>
```

If our form does not have an action attribute it will attempt to POST to the URL we are currently on, making it appear as though our page is being refreshed. Even though it looks like the page is being refreshed, that is not technically what is happening. The form is sending a POST request out into the void

We can avoid this by telling our event handler to prevent that functionality with .preventDefault() 
````

  const commentForm = document.getElementById('comment-form')
  commentForm.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault() 
    
    //stop form from POSTING
    
    console.log(event.target) //form
  })

```
